# Jarvis_Voice_Assistance
Jarvis is a simple yet powerful AI-based Voice Assistant built using Python. It can listen to your commands, process them using AI, and respond in a human-like voice. This project demonstrates the integration of speech recognition, text-to-speech, and OpenAI API for smart conversational responses.
